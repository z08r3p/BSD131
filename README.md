Task details 
Background: 
Researchers are interested in determining the spending habits of 1000 
students across various demographic groups and academic backgrounds. A 
survey was undertaken to collect data on age, gender, year in school, major, monthly income, financial aid received, and expenses in different spending 
categories. Spending categories include tuition, housing, food, transportation, books and supplies, entertainment, personal care, technology, health and 
wellness, and miscellaneous expenses. Additionally, the dataset includes the preferred payment method for each student. 
Data key: 
The definitions of each of the data columns is as follows: 
• Age: Age of the student (in years) 
• Gender: Gender of the student (Male, Female, Non-binary) 
• Year in School: Year of study (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior) 
• Major: Field of study or major 
• Monthly Income: Monthly income of the student (in dollars) 
• Financial Aid: Financial aid received by the student (in dollars) 
• Tuition: Expenses for tuition (in dollars) 
• Housing: Expenses for housing (in dollars) 

• Food: Expenses for food (in dollars) 

• Transportation: Expenses for transportation (in dollars) 

• Books  Supplies: Expenses for books and supplies (in dollars) 

• Entertainment: Expenses for entertainment (in dollars) 

• Personal Care: Expenses for personal care items (in dollars) 

• Technology: Expenses for technology (in dollars) 

• Health  Wellness: Expenses for health and wellness (in dollars) 

• Miscellaneous: Miscellaneous expenses (in dollars) 

• Preferred Payment Method: Preferred payment method (Cash, 

Credit/Debit Card, Mobile Payment App) 
Instructions: You are    required to work through the CRISP-DM    process    by answering the questions    below. You are  expected to    use    academic    language and to    refer explicitly to the data to support your points. This is not a research task, so there will be no citations or reference list. It is very important for you to conduct this analysis yourself and not to access any generative AI software. The use of this type of software is not authorised in this unit. 
Part A: Explain  Understand the Process of the CRISP-DM Model 
1.          What       is       the       importance       of defining       business       objectives       at       the beginning of a data mining project? 
2.          Why is data cleaning and pre-processing important in the data mining process? 
3.          What       are       the          key       considerations          when       selecting          a       modelling technique? 
4.          Discuss the importance of model evaluation and validation. 
5.          What    are    the    challenges    associated    wit代 写BSD131: Assessment Task 2Java

Part B: Data Preparation and Descriptive Statistics 
Using the dataset supplied. 
1.          What questions would the researchers have regarding this dataset? 
2.          Are there any issues with the data or other variables that could be collected to help answer the researchers’ questions? 
3.          Are    there    any    unusual    observations    in    the    data    set? Identify    their values and any potential problems that they could cause (Hint: think of the results that could be affected) 
4.          Prepare a one-page dashboard (box plots, time series plot, bar charts and any relevant tables) that can be used to describe the main features of the dataset. 
Part   C: Statistical Analysis of the   Data
1. What    is the    relationship  between Age    and    Monthly    Income? This   could help understand if   there's a correlation between age and earning   potential.
2. How does Year in School relate to Monthly Income? This   could   reveal   whether   income tends to   increase as students’   progress through   their   academic years.
3. Is       there       a       relationship       between       Major  and Monthly Income? Exploring whether certain fields of study   lead to   higher   incomes.
4. What factors influence Tuition expenses? Analysing how variables like   Financial Aid and Year   in School   impact tuition   costs.
5. Does Preferred Payment Method relate    to    any other variables? Investigating      whether       payment       preferences       are       associated       with   demographic or financial factors.
6. How    do various    expenses    (e.g.,    Books  Supplies,    Entertainment) relate to each other? Understanding   spending   patterns   and   potential   trade-offs   between different categories.
7. Can       we       predict       Total       Expenses       based on individual spending categories? Building   a   model to   estimate total   expenses   based   on the   breakdown of spending across different   categories.
8. Does    Financial    Aid impact    the relationship between Income and Expenses? Exploring    whether    financial    aid    mitigates    the      impact    of   income on expenditure   patterns.
9. How       do          Health                    Wellness       expenses          vary          across       different demographics? Investigating   whether   certain   groups   spend   more   on   health-related items.
10. What is    the       impact of    Age, Gender, and       Major on    Technology expenses? Exploring how demographic and academic factors influence   technology spending   habits.
Part D: Final Conclusions
Provide a comprehensive analysis of key insights derived from the dataset, spanning demographic information, academic standing, income, expenses, and payment preferences. Your response should encompass a detailed examination of the data trends, highlighting notable correlations, issues, and potential implications for any decision-making and strategic planning to better support students.
